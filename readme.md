Miro test task for backend developer.

Assuming that 90% of operations are read operations, I decided to create storage structure that:
1. Let fast get widget by Id.
2. Storing all widgets alrady sorted by z-index and let fast get sorted list of widgets.

Unfortunately I didn't have time, but it was in my plan:
- to add logging
- to add swagger 
- to add more tests
- to implement complication number 3 (SQL database)

Apologize for:
- ugly tests 
- low quality pagination implementation 
- my crooked hands
